# Midterm Project Brief

Build a command-line `wc`-like toolkit with modular design.

Requirements:
- Subcommands for counts (lines/words/chars/longest)
- Stream stdin or files; large-file friendly
- Packaging as a Python package with entry point
- Logging + error handling
- Tests covering edge cases

Deliverables:
- Package source, README, tests, usage examples
- Brief AI vs human comparison write-up
