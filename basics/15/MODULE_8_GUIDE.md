# Module 8: Pythonic Best Practices & Continuous Improvement

## Learning Objectives
- Write readable, maintainable, and idiomatic Python
- Apply PEP 8 and "The Zen of Python" in real code
- Use documentation, testing, and tooling effectively
- Continuously review, refactor, and improve codebases

## Core Concepts
- PEP 8 style: naming, whitespace, imports, line length
- Docstrings (PEP 257), type hints (PEP 484), comments etiquette
- Code formatting (black), linting (flake8), imports (isort)
- Testing (pytest), coverage, property-based tests basics
- Performance basics: profiling, big-O, data structure choices
- Code reviews: checklists, anti-patterns, refactoring strategies

## Hands-on Path
- Quick Checks: identify PEP 8 violations; fix docstrings
- Try This: apply black/isort/flake8; add tests; add type hints
- Labs: refactor a module; write tests; measure before/after perf

### Code Review Checklist (add-on)
- Naming and clarity; comments/docstrings explain "why"
- Function size and responsibility
- Input validation and error messages
- Tests present for edge cases; coverage reasonable
- Performance: avoid needless work; appropriate data structures

### Profiling and Measurement
- Use `timeit` for micro-benchmarks; `cProfile` for hotspots.
- Always measure before and after refactoring.

### AI-comparison callout
Compare AI refactors with human solutions for:
- Behavior preservation and test pass rates
- Readability and maintainability
- Over-optimization vs clarity tradeoffs

## Best Practices
- Readability counts; explicit over implicit
- Small, focused functions and modules
- Consistent project structure and tooling
- Measure performance and test before refactoring
- Document "why" decisions in README/ADR notes
