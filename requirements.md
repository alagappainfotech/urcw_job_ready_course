**Module 1: Python Fundamentals for Robust Applications**

**Objective:** Solidify foundational Python concepts, focusing on how they contribute to clean, maintainable, and explicit code, essential for enterprise-grade applications.

*   **Concepts to Master:**
    *   **Variables, Data Types, and Operators:** Integers, floats, Booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
    *   **Control Flow:** `if-elif-else` statements, `while` loops, `for` loops, `match-case` statements.
    *   **Functions:** Definition, parameters, arguments, return values, documentation strings (`docstrings`).
    *   **Basic Input/Output:** User input with `input()`, basic file operations (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`).

*   **Practical Examples & Exercises:**
    1.  **"Hello, World!" and Basic Interaction:** Write a program that takes a user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting. Experiment with different **data types** (strings, integers) and **operators**.
    2.  **List and Dictionary Manipulation:** Create a program that stores product names and their prices in a dictionary. Allow users to add new products, update prices, and view the entire inventory. Utilize **list operations** like `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `min()`, `max()`, `index()`, `count()`, and the `in` operator, and **dictionary operations** like `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, and `update()`.
    3.  **Conditional Logic and Loops:** Simulate a simple login system with a username and password. Implement logic to check credentials using `if-elif-else` and allow a limited number of attempts using a `while` loop. Iterate through a list of numbers and print only the even ones using a `for` loop.
    4.  **Function Refactoring:** Take your dictionary inventory program and refactor its logic into **reusable functions** for adding, updating, and viewing items. Ensure clear **docstrings** for each function.

*   **Proficiency Check:** Can you write clear, self-documenting code that follows PEP 8 for all basic operations? Do you understand the difference between mutable and immutable data types and their implications for function arguments?.

---

**Module 2: Advanced Data Structures & Functional Programming Paradigms**

**Objective:** Leverage Python's powerful features like comprehensions, generators, and decorators for more efficient and concise code, crucial for optimizing enterprise applications.

*   **Concepts to Master:**
    *   **List, Set, and Dictionary Comprehensions:** Efficiently create collections.
    *   **Generator Expressions and Functions:** Memory-efficient iteration.
    *   **Lambda Functions:** Anonymous functions for concise operations.
    *   **`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`:** Functional programming tools.
    *   **Decorators:** Modify functions/classes behavior dynamically.
    *   **Context Managers (`with` statement):** Resource management.
    *   **Multiple Function Arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`):** Flexible function design.
    *   **`zip()` and `enumerate()`:** Useful iteration patterns.

*   **Practical Examples & Exercises:**
    1.  **Data Transformation with Comprehensions and Lambdas:**
        *   Given a list of dictionaries representing user data (e.g., `[{'name': 'Alice', 'score': 85}, {'name': 'Bob', 'score': 92}]`), use a **list comprehension** to extract only the names, and a **dictionary comprehension** to create a new dictionary mapping names to scores for users with scores over 90.
        *   Use **`filter()` with a `lambda` function** to get all scores above a certain threshold.
    2.  **Efficient Log Processing with Generators:** Imagine processing a large log file line by line. Create a **generator function** that yields only error messages (lines containing "ERROR") from a given file, avoiding loading the entire file into memory.
    3.  **Authentication Decorator:** Write a **decorator** that can be applied to functions requiring administrative privileges. If a user tries to access a decorated function without being an admin (e.g., a boolean flag), it should raise a `PermissionError`.
    4.  **Custom Context Manager:** Implement a **context manager** (either as a class or using `@contextmanager`) for ensuring a network connection is properly opened and closed, even if errors occur during its use. Test its behavior with and without exceptions.

*   **Proficiency Check:** Can you write concise, Pythonic code that leverages comprehensions and generators for performance? Do you understand how and when to use decorators and context managers effectively for resource management and code modification?.

    *   **Instance vs. Class Variables and Methods:** Understanding scope and usage.
    *   **Inheritance (Single & Multiple):** Modeling "is-a" relationships, `super()` for method calling, mixins.
    *   **Encapsulation & Private Members:** Using naming conventions (`_`, `__`) for internal attributes/methods.
    *   **Properties (`@property`):** Controlled access to attributes.
    *   **Special (Magic/Dunder) Methods:** Customizing object behavior (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, etc.).
    *   **Duck Typing:** Embracing Python's dynamic nature.

*   **Practical Examples & Exercises:**
    1.  **Modeling a User Management System:**
        *   Design a `User` class with attributes like `username`, `email`, and `is_admin`. Implement methods for `login()` and `logout()`. Use **`@property`** for read-only access to `username` and controlled setting of `email`.
        *   Create `AdminUser` and `StandardUser` classes that **inherit** from `User`. `AdminUser` should have additional methods for managing other users (e.g., `deactivate_user()`). Ensure proper `__init__` calls using `super()`.
        *   Implement **`__str__` and `__repr__`** methods for `User` objects to provide clear string representations for logging and debugging.
    2.  **HTML Element Renderer (Advanced):**
        *   Develop a hierarchy of classes (`HtmlElement`, `Paragraph`, `Div`, `Span`) that represent HTML tags. The base `HtmlElement` class should handle generic attributes and content.
        *   Implement the `__str__` method in `HtmlElement` to render the HTML tag, its attributes, and content recursively, similar to the provided HTML example. Subclasses should only define their tag names.
        *   Experiment with **multiple inheritance** by creating a `ClickableElement` mixin that adds `onclick` functionality to any HTML element.
    3.  **String-Only Dictionary:** Create a class `StringDict` that **subclasses Python's built-in `dict` type** but only allows strings for both keys and values. Override `__setitem__()` and `__init__()` to enforce this constraint, raising a `TypeError` if non-string types are attempted.

*   **Proficiency Check:** Can you design a class hierarchy that effectively models a complex domain? Do you understand how to use special methods to make your custom objects behave like built-in types? Can you apply encapsulation and inheritance to create reusable and maintainable code?.

        *   Create modules like `text_analyzer/cleaning.py` (for text normalization), `text_analyzer/counter.py` (for word counting and statistics), and `text_analyzer/exceptions.py` (for custom exceptions).
        *   Create a proper `__init__.py` file to manage imports and expose key functions at the package level.
        *   Write a client script that imports and uses functions from your `text_analyzer` package to process a text file (e.g., "moby_01.txt").
    2.  **Dependency Management Simulation:**
        *   Create a new Python project. Initialize a **virtual environment** for it.
        *   Use `pip` to install a popular **third-party library** like `requests`.
        *   Demonstrate how to freeze dependencies into a `requirements.txt` file and install them in another environment.

*   **Proficiency Check:** Can you logically organize a multi-file project into a Python package? Do you understand how `__init__.py` and the module search path work? Can you effectively manage project dependencies using virtual environments and `pip`?.

    *   **Assertions (`assert` statement):** Validating assumptions in code.
    *   **Logging (`logging` module):** Structured message output, different log levels, handlers, formatters.
    *   **Debugging Tools:** Using an interactive debugger (e.g., Python Tutor, `pdb`), tracebacks, `diffchecker`.

*   **Practical Examples & Exercises:**
    1.  **Robust File Processing:** Enhance your `text_analyzer` package's file reading and writing functions to **handle potential `IOError` exceptions** (e.g., file not found, permission denied). Implement custom exceptions for application-specific errors, such as `EmptyFileError`.
    2.  **Input Validation with Assertions:** In your user management system (from Module 3), add **`assert` statements** to validate that critical inputs (e.g., email format, password strength) meet expected criteria before processing. Experiment with turning assertions on/off.
    3.  **Structured Logging for Production:** Modify your `text_analyzer` package to use the **`logging` module**. Log information, warnings, and errors to both the console and a file. Configure different log levels for development and production environments.
    4.  **Debugging a Complex Function:** Introduce an intentional bug into one of your functions (e.g., an off-by-one error in a loop). Use **Python Tutor** or an interactive debugger to step through the code, inspect variable states, and identify the root cause of the bug.

*   **Proficiency Check:** Can you anticipate potential errors and implement appropriate exception handling strategies (EAFP - "easier to ask forgiveness than permission")? Are you proficient in using logging for monitoring and debugging applications in a production environment? Can you effectively use debugging tools to diagnose and fix complex issues?.
